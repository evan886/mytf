* 18 Protest
A:This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O’Connell reporting live from Washington, D. C. where a protest has broken out. Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O’Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what’s happening?
B:Yeah, yeah, we’re here because we feel this is an injustice! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We’re there to show the government that we don’t like the way that they’re spending our tax dollars!
A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?
B:It’s an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.
A:I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.
B:That maybe true, and I for one don’t want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they’re making millions of dollars?

B:Well, let’s see, there are a few points we need to
be thinking about. . . first, I’ll need you to analyze our numbers and figure out what kind of financial impact an outbreak might have.
A:You’ll also need to think about how we can avoid any of our employees getting infected; think of ways to reduce employee-customer contact, perhaps some IT solutions that will allow our people to work from home.
C:I guess you’ll need me to forecast employee absences as well, right? And I’ll think about the impact this will have on our clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?
A:Exactly right. So, I’ll leave this to you, and we’ll review the draft plan in two weeks. Okay, so, anyone want to order some KFC for lunch?

* 65 Job Interview III
A:Very good. Now, I have a couple of final questions.
B:I hope they’re not too hard!
A:Well, why should we hire you?
B:I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building  strong, long-term customer relationships.For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers’ problems.I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products,so after I implemented a series of training sessions in  coordination with our technical department,we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers’ issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.
A:Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?
B:To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.
I find it hard to organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I’m getting better now.

*  78 International Workers Day 
A: Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we  celebrate on May first?
B: Cinco de mayo? /ˌsɪŋ.koʊ ðeɪ ˈmaɪ.oʊ/
A: No, that’s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers’ Day.
B: Do we get a day off from school then?
A: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.
B: Aww, man!
A: In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day.  Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working
conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.
B: Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?
A: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.
B:And then what happened?
A:Well, as we say, the rest is history...

A:Hi! We are the Christianson’s! We are here to see  the apartment.
B:Oh, hi! Sure, come on in! Well, as you can see,  the place has just been renovated. The previous  tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has redone everything.
A:It looks great. It’s so bright and airy! What great  light! I really like these hardwood floors. What’s the square footage of this place?
B:Well, it’s about 120 square meters, or 1300 ( thirteen hundred ) square feet, more or less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances. There’s  a new dishwasher, and a professional-grade gas  range. Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal! 
A:I love it! But what are the payment terms? 
B:First and last month rent as deposit and rent is  due on the 1st of every month. Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it’s  a very good deal!
A:Yes, it is! Too good to be true...
B:The living room and dinning room are quite spacious as you can see, and down this hall, here’s the master bedroom. It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suit bathroom. We can’t go in there yet as the police... I mean the clean up crew hasn’t finished.

The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It’s a real mess.

A: Honey,  do you have a second?
B: Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?
B: We need  to talk.       B: Okay...
A: I’ve been thinking, and well, I think we need to  start seeing other people.
B:What? Why? I mean, we’ve had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we’re happy together, aren’t we?
A:That’s just it, I’m not happy anymore, Tim. It’s not you, it’s me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!
B:So, what are you saying? You’re breaking up with  me because I’m perfect?
A: Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I  could say that I’ll be all you need, but that would  be a lie. I know I’d only hurt you, I know I’d only  make you cry.
B:Baby, come on. Don’t do this to me! Whatever  it is, we can work it out. Just give me another  chance! I know that we can get through this, but  we gotta stick together! Don’t leave me.
A: I can’t, Tim. I hope someday you can find some  way to understand I’m only doing this for you. I don’t really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.
B:Laura...

B:All right, were’re here at the eighth hole. It’s a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.  Although, I did  see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very  same hole!
A:Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let’s see if  he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very  nervous.
B:Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It’s definitely not his day today.On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will  definitely not get a birdie on this shot.
A:It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it  and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and  spot it.

A: Good afternoon! Did you call for a plumber
B:Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I’m so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there’s water leaking everywhere!
A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s not working either. I suspect that there’s some sort of foreign object in  the pipes that’s causing a blockage. That’s what’s  making your toilet overflow.
B: Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the  toilet. You know how kids are.
A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not  drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’s urgent.

Steven: It was fine. I’ve been better but, it’s great to  be home, I’ve missed you all! How’s mom?
Gulam:She’s great! All she ever does is talk about you -her little boy that went to the United States. You’re her pride and joy, you know that?
Steven:Can’t wait to see her. And you? What’s new  with you?
Gulam:Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You’ll have  another nephew or niece soon!
Steven:That’s great! Wow! Congrats! You two are great together, ya know. You have such a beautiful family. I hope one day I can have that.
Gulam:Of course, man! Come on! I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini! You know, she’s still pining after you. I don’t think she’ll ever get over you.
Steven:What are you talking about? I hardly knew  her! How could she be in love with me? I  couldn’t go through with it even though she  is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the  United States. I just hope Veronica is happy.
Gulam:Get over it! You’re home now. Everyone  here thinks so highly of you; there’ll be girls  throwing themselves at you. You can marry anyone you want!
Steven:I don’t want to marry anyone! I want to  marry her! Don’t you understand?

Veronica: I also have some little secrets that I haven’t  told you about, but we can discuss that later. I realized that I was just scared. Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment  that marriage requires. I’m here now. Now  there is something I wanna ask you. Steven, will you marry me?

B:Yeah how’d you know?
A:You can always spot the newbies. I can give you a few pointers if you want. Were you trying to use this machine here?
B:Yeah! I just started my training today and I’m not really sure where to begin.
A:It’s ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?
B:Well, I don’t want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.
A:In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it’s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.
B:Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that’s a lot of weight!

B:So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine  stain? How do I get it out?
A:Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.

* 136  Gambling

A: Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business!
B:Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built  on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.
A: What are you talking about? How does it exploit people?
B: Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted.
Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape,
and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction.
Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal  bookies.
A: Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’t become addicted or anything like that.
B: You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!

Daddy: Bobby! Come here, look what I got you!
Bobby: What is that?
Daddy: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!
Bobby: Cool!
Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.
Bobby:  What about all these other pieces?
Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important  piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it.
Bobby: And these two? They are husband and   wife?
Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king,
he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is  over! Doesn’t this sound fun?

* 165 Asking For A Loan

B:Hello Sir may I help you?
A:Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.
B:Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans. 
A:I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?
B:It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months,you would have to pay each month a portion of the  loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate.   This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!  
A:It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.
B:That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.
A:You know what? I don’t really need the money. Thanks anyways!

B: Thank you.
A: So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.
C: Yes thats correct. Frankly speaking our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems, but I think this is the  main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.
B: We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours and not to mention our mortgage and car payments. With the recent economic downturn, my husband’s  business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how  we can prepare a family budget.
A: I see. Well you have come tothe right place. First what we need to do, is determine your cash flow. Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.
B:Yes that makes sense.
A: Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months. That way, we can determine what your average expenditures are  and see which category you are spending money on the most. Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that, but we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing. 
C: Great! We will do that then! Now how about we  treat you to a nice dinner?
A: That’s another thing. If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards!

B: Have you ever written up a business plan before?
A: Well,no, it can’t be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that’s it,
right?
B: You couldn’t be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two  pages or less. Then you need to describe your  company with information such as what type of  legal structure it has, history, etc.
A: Well, that seems easy enough.
B: Wait, there’s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.   You  need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables!  You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.
A: Geez. Is that all?
B: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash  flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!
A: Umm. I think I’ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!

A:Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings  time?
B: What? Why do we have to do that?
A:Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the  afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In  any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.
B:I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!
A:That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here  in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!

B:  That’s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing  to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even  though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s like we went back in time!

So as you mentioned, the person that makes suits is a tailor. That's right, you can say my uncle is a tailor. He makes clothes for famous people but this word is also a verb. That means it's an action word. We can say my uncle the tailor, he tailors clothes. Okay, so to tailor clothes and what does it mean when you say to Taylor well can have two meanings? The first is what we learn about in today's dialogue it means to make.Make clothes, so to make a shirt or to make a pair of pants. But these days we often say Taylor, which means to.Fix something. So, for example, Marco, if you buy a pair of pants.And they're too long right? You can have them tailored have been tailored and that means that I am going to have them fixed so they fit me properly exactly. This is a lot more common right now. Okay? So we're gonna be tailoring close. Now, if any of you have ever been to the tailor what they do is they measure you and what do they measure? Well in this case they get the width of your shoulders. What's really great about these upcoming words is that they're useful in math as well math and basic measurements. So what is how a big something is across cross? How wide something is exactly why with okay. So that's the width. Now your shoulders they are wide and well your legs on the other hand

Your shoulders. They are wide and, well, your legs. On the other hand, your legs and arms, you don't measure the width usually measure.You measure that link, how long they are okay.So with and length, now just throw it in there. This wasn't in the dialogue but won't be the other measure word. So the third word would be height. So you think of a rectangle. Ah, you have the width. How wide? Something is the length, how long it is in the height, how tall? Tall, right?So with length and height, alright, now that we've measured our arms and legs, now we want to measure our waist.Okay, this is the important one, this is also the sensitive.One, if you find that you gained some weight, we measure the waste. Okay, that's how big you are around your stomach. And so usually we measure this in a circle. Okay, okay so you've heard of a 26 inch waist or 32 inch ways, this is the size of your stomach, okay? So it's just above your hips, right? As you say it's your stomach and well we measure the wa and now in men, especially they measure the in insane. Now this is very particular for tailors and having suits me, what is it it seem?Well, think of the word in inside. This is the.The inside of your pants. So from your foot to the middle of your pants where your zippers start. Okay, so that's not the outside length, it's the inside length. Okay, now for example skirts they don't have instinct, right? No, because there's no inside. There's no milk, right? So it's just like a circle, okay, but in pants or shorts you have it in.See, that's where it's a connected in the middle. Alright, so also in short, very interesting so you can measure the of pants or shorts. Alright, so very interesting in particular words for tailors, why don't we listen to our dialogue again and move back shortly


Actually, now we have three key phrases that we found in this dialogue. So let's take a look at them now in fluency build.Fluency builder this first phrase is the topic of today's lesson. A, we talked a little bit about measurements for a suit.Suits, but in particular we're getting a custom made suit.So this word custom made well. Custom is important. It means special or unique. There's no other like it. So we could talk about custom cars. That means a car that has been fixed.OK, so a custom made.For your height. For how big thingsc specifically for you?Right, so a suit that I buy at the department store is just a normal suit, but a suit that I have made for me is a custom made.And as you said, you can use it for cars, car or maybe, for example, a custom.Custom made kitchen. That means that you get to pick every single part of the kitchen that you want. Many people do that right? They have custom built or custom made homes? Yeah, that's, that's always something I wanted to do but I hear that it's much more expensive than getting a normal homemade. Alright, so that's the first key phrase now moving on   08:00

So a little bit too short, but when you come to a place like China, and most people can get these.Made for them, they just look.Look fab looks very, very nice.Yeah, so

First key phrase now moving on, when we talk about measuring, we say I measured, I measured the length of the street.Right. Or let's measure you so we can see how big you are. But if you notice in the dial

B:Me! Me!
A:Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing.We must lift the person’s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.
B:Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like this!
A:Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.
B:Well, ok. But no French kissing!
A:As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again.
To do this, we place our hands over the person’s chest, and press down firmly two or three times.
B:Wait, what are you doing! You can’t just kiss me  then go for second base!( touch the breast[brest] )

They’ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!

A:Wow, that sounds pretty safe. So how do you pay? Do you need a credit card?

B:What do you mean? What happened?
A:There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points, the DOW JONES indicator also suffered!Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago.
B:How is this possible? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return!
A:I know sir! We didn’t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden. On the other hand you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets. We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

Jun 07 2024
Hi Daniel. How are you holding up? I'm greatly sorry for your loss.
Thank you. I'm much better. I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

How's that going?
It's a lot harder than I imagined. There are many things that you have to arrange. I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.
Have you brought a burial plot and a casket?
No. Wendy is being cremated. She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried. I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.
I see. That sounds like something she would have really liked. I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful. You're doing a great job.
Thanks.It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.

A:She what?
B:Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ve got  it all planned out. There’s almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending.
A:four hundred?
B:No need to sweat it My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be lowbudget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue.I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer.My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she’s going to be a professional opera singer?
A:Ah...
B:And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister’s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what’s their name again? I was thinking that we could
have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we’ll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors?Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!
A:Wow.
B:See? It’s going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.

Doctor Evans:Ok Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?You really are all bunged up, you don’t sound too good at all. Ok I’m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics. You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening. You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals. Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless. . . just to clear up your lungs!

*  237 Morning Routine

Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?

Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.
Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up , you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half  an hour, tops.

Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and  head straight for the shower. Every  second day , I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need  to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily.
Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out  too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in  under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get  dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning.
In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight.
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.
Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?
Stephanie:Not funny

Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview. I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your
background.
Yes, of course. Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Although our family moved to London when I was quite young. At around 16.
So you were actually educated in Europe.
Yes, precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My father was in the oil business before he retired. So we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.
Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

B:Certainly sir, this is our train schedule. We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm.

B:About twelve hours. We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train. If you’d like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive.

一年后听明白了 Jun 05 2024 
Mr. Parsons: Okay, now I’d like to find out more about your last job. I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right?
Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn’t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.
Mr. Parsons: So, what changed?
Rebecca: Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer .
Mr. Parsons: Wow, a real step up!
Rebecca: Yes I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent (restaurant)three  years in that position, but to be honest it wasn’t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term.
Mr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?
Rebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn’t offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.

* 249 Making A Sandwich
A:Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started !
A:Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.
A:Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.
A: Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident-ucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.
A:Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce,
mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!
A:That’s all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we’ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!

*  252 Contraceptives
A: Alright, settle down everyone. As part of this school’s curriculum we’ll be covering sex ed this week.
A:Now I want everyone to take this class seriously,  sexual education is very important and I want you  to ask as many questions as you can think of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.
B :Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education?  Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff  like that?
A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work.
B:My older sister is in college and she takes what  she and her friends call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.
A:Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our  first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect 
her from contracting STD’s from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms.  This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD’s. Yes  Jason?
B:What are condoms made out of? How exactly is  it that a woman gets pregnant?
A:Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As for your other question,  that’s a whole new class.

B:Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are  basic rules that you must abide by in order to be  safe. For example, never handle a weapon that
you haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn’t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!
A:Wow, I didn’t know! It always looks so cool and  easy in the movies!
B:The reality is different you know, running and firing  a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?
A:Let’s do it!

*  263  Nationalities

A:Hey! How was your first day of class? I’m in level two and I’m loving my class this semester! It’s great being in a class of international students!
B:Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.
A:That’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians!
B:That’s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and  one Russian.
A:Well, I think you’re pretty lucky actually. You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.
B:I guess so, but I think it’s going to be hard to relate  to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes. 
A:Don’t! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will  be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass  mine with all that practice.
B:I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.
A:Well, there is that, yes.

* 264  Toothache

A: What seems to be the problem?
B:I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can’t eat anything.
A: Let’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against your molars and that’s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.
B:When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?
A:First we will take some x-rays and see what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.
B:I guess that’s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.
A:It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!

A: Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

A:What sort of pest are we dealing with?
B:We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the  wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!
A:Well, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.
B:No problem, just get rid of the bugs!

A:That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those?
B: No, we’re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.

*  269 Marketing Plan
A:Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.
B:Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers. Why aren’t we doing the same thing?
A:I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than shortterm sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.
B:Customers don’t care about the coffee anymore. They only care about the price.
A:I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time.We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.
C:That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors.I think the main question  is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.
A:That’s the main question I would like to discuss today.
B:Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.
C:That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?
A:Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee  beans.

B:I’d like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed. The presentation today is divided into five main parts.
B:First of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the background of the new x420 line; how the whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.  [ɪɡˈzɪstɪŋ]
B:Secondly I’dlike to present data on projected sales for the x420. We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector. Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the x420.

Mel: Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.
Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.
Mel: Oh, I don’t know... it’s hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.
Grace: I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

Lydia:Hello?
Maggie:Hey! Do you want to go out tonight?
Lydia:No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up with me. I feel awful.
Maggie:What?!? What happened? Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together!
Lydia:I don’t know what I did wrong. He said he needed some space to figure things out... He said I didn’t do anything wrong, that I’m a great person... just not the one for him...
Maggie:Ugh! That’s so cliché. Mark’s not worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much better!
Lydia:I know we had hit a rough patch but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend, when we both had some time off... I think he found someone else.  I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending  a lot of time with a coworker...
Maggie:Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about him! There are many more fish in the sea. [dʒɜːrk]

*  284  Tune Up

修复

A:Welcome to Al’s Garage. What seems to be the  problem?
B:No problem at all! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical  condition.
A:Very wise decision. When was the last time you  had a tune up?
B:Not that long ago, I think it was four months ago.
A:We usually recommend that you bring your car in  every five thousand kilometers.  
B:Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that  you need to check it so often?

A:First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If  you don’t do this, it can cause your engine to wear  faster and that means you would probably have to  change the pistons and intake valves.
B:I see. What else?

A:We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and  other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also  check the clutch and brakes to determine when   you will need new ones.
B:Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’t seem  like a waste of time and money.
A:Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.

B:Really? Are you sure?
A:Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger  on my back.
B:Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have  heard it hurts a lot!
A:Really?
B:Of course! They use this machine with a needle  that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.
A:Oh, I didn’t know that! I thought they just paint it  on your skin or something.
B:I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic.

Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let’s just reboot and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the issue.
Jonathan: Right, lets try again. No, still nothing Michael. There might be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the  projector has overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again. I’ll call IT support to come over right now.
Mr. Ford:Okay guys.  Unfortunately technical  problems do crop up from time to time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge problem.

Andrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think I’m going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll , and egg drop soup.  [roʊl]
Manny:It’s so tempting to order everything on the  menu, it all looks so appetizing! I think  I’ll get General Tso’s chicken, hot and sour  soup, fried wontons, and white rice.
Andrea:Aren’t you supposed to be on a diet? You  should at least get brown rice.
Manny:I don’t think so! I hate brown rice, and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time. I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorieladen Chinese food. I might even get an order of broccoli beef!

But there's also delivery and delivery is when you order the food and someone else brings
it to you.

As we mentioned, these dishes have a certain American influence to them.
They're not really spicy. I think that's the main difference as well. American Chinese food doesn't really have the intense garlic flavor nor is it spicy like usual Chinese food.

Janice:Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end lap-top market.
Janice:How does Mr. Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

Mr. Ford:Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I think you have hit the nail on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.
Mr. Ford:But, although we can’t compete in terms of size I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer  service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that contest.

Frank:Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you elaborate on  the actual technical details of the x420 a little more?
Mr. Ford:I’d love to but I think we are a little pressed for time right now. However Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the powerpoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time
Marcie:Mr. Ford. One final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

A:That is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like that?
B:It’s the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

A:You want to go to the movies tonight?
B:Sure! What’s playing?
A:The new Twilight movie!
B:Twilight? As in the vampire movies? No way I am watching that. I don’t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires [ˈvæmpaɪrz] . It doesn’t make sense.
A:Of course it does. It’s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that is in love but can’t be to gether because they are so different. Add in the fact that immortality and super human strength is really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie  even more enticing.

A: Are you excited about your trip next month?
B: Yes and no. I can’t wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I am terrified.
A: Why?
B: Well, I have aero phobia [ˈfoʊbiə]. I have a chronic fear of flying.
A:Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It’s not that bad though, I mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually  have arachnophobia.
B: You’re scared of spiders? I actually have two more  phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia
A: I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.
B: Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly  speak.
A: Well, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic. I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds.
B: We are such weirdos right?

I cannot wait to go to Europe, but at the same time, I'm terrified.

Are you kidding?
So this is actually a way of showing some sarcasm when you're talking because public
you're being a little bit sarcastic, but at the same time, you're also acting a bit surprised.

determined    US: [dɪˈtɜrmɪnd]    adj.决心；决定；决意；坚定



So now you brought up an interesting point.
Our last phobia, we said claustrophobic and now we must make the difference between, for
example, claustrophobia and being claustrophobic.
So a phobia, you hear the word, you hear the ending IA, phobia, claustrophobia is a noun.
That means I can talk about, I have it, I have this fear.
But when you're talking about the adjective, something that describes you, you would have
to use the ic ending.
I'm claustrophobic.
He is acrophobic.
They are aerophobic.
Okay, so that is the adjective form.

So when you learn those words, remember that there's two different kinds.
There's the IA, there's the IA, a phobia, which is the noun and ic, which is the adjective.

*  305 Bowling

A: Alright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.
B:Why not?
A:Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down. If you step there you will slip and fall.
B:OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now, how the heck  do I play this?
A:You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins. If you do, that is called a strike.  if you don’t knock them all down on the first try,
then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to get.
B:Got it! OK, I’m gonna give it a go. Oh no! My ball went in the gutter!
A:I told you, its harder than you think. Now let a pro show you how it’s done.

lane [leɪn]    n.车道；小巷
a narrow road in the countryside or in a town
polish: [ˈpɑlɪʃ]     n.抛光；擦亮；上光；上光剂     v.抛光
slip  [slɪp]
strike [straɪk]    v.罢工；击；攻击；打     n.罢工；打击；袭击；罢课     网络好球
spare [sper]    v.抽出；匀出；饶恕；不遗余力    adj.不用的；闲置的
frame [freɪm]    n.框架；【机】架；【影视】画面；【园】温床     v.想像；诬陷；编制；构造
score [skɔr]    n.成绩；比分；总谱；伤痕     v.评分
gutter [ˈɡʌtər]    n.阴沟；檐沟；天沟；路旁排水沟     v.忽明忽暗；摇曳不定    网络槽；

So it is a very social activity.
That's right.
So maybe a group of people will rent a lane.
Remember, we were talking earlier about a lane being that one kind of strip of wood
where you roll the ball.
Well, a group of friends can rent a lane or two lanes and the four or the eight of you
can play together, each person playing one frame at a time.
That's right.
And now actually, the other thing about it is it's very funny to see people trying to
bowl or maybe with the heavy ball or maybe they pass the line that we said they shouldn't
pass and they slip and fall.
So I guess that's what also makes it a little bit fun to play.

 pastime 消遣 ; 休闲活动 
so now how the heck do I play this?
I'm going, I'm gonna give it a go.
now let a pro show you how it's done.

A:Maybe you just need a few pick up lines,you know, break the ice.
B:Pick up lines don’t work!
A:Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say: “If you were a booger I’d pick you first.”
B:What? Come on! That’s just lame! No girl would fall for that!
A:Fine, then you can say: “So there you are! I’ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams!”
B:That’s a good one! I think that’s pretty funny.
A:Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.
B:Ok, how does this sound: “I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.”

A:Sounds good! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.
B:Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you don’t use  any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice.

*  324 Thanksgiving Dinner 

A: So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?
B: Not much really. It’s more of an American tradition, so back home we don’t really celebrate it. In fact, I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated!
A: Well you know, it’s a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything!
B: Yeah but, how did this holiday come to be?
A:Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.  Once inthe New World, they befriended an native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area  such as corn.
And then what happened?
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter and in celebration they decided to have a big feast with the natives,  giving thanks to the land and everyone for their  food, health and new lives.
B:Interesting! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are!
A: Come to my house for Thanksgiving! We are having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy, and lots of stuffing!
B: Count me in!

A:Ok, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?
B:Almost, let me just put my apron on. 
A:Ok, so the first thing we are going to do is preheat the oven, that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything.  Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.
B:Got it.
A:No we are gonna make the batter. Take some  butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract  and eggs and continue mixing.
B:Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric  mixer?
A:Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium  speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and baking powder  separately and then we can mix it with milk and  the rest of the ingredients.
B:Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?
A:Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won’t  stick to it when it bakes.
B:Done. So how long do we bake it for?
A:We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.
B:Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!
